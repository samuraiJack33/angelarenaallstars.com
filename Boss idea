I had an idea for a boss however it was only the core idea that I had not the fully though out idea.  The boss would be based on illusions, and it would kind of split up making clones of itself and the more clones that are available the stronger the boss is, maybe they all have a connection to a pillar in the middle of the arena meaning taht there is also a lack of vision in the arena making it slightly harder to know how many clones are in the arena. The more clones that have this connection to the central pillar the stronger that their attacks become.
