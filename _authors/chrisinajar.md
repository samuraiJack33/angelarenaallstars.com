Hi, I'm Chris. I am one of the founders of this project, specifically kicking off the coding side of things. I've been programming professionally for over a decade, and since I spend most of my time neck deep in open source I've been able to help get the community functioning more productively and collaboratively.

My main goals with this project are pretty simple. First and most obviously, I want to have something fun to work on when I get home and don't feel like playing videogames. I also want to see if something simple like a Dota gamemode can actually sustain the momentum needed to function like a healthy open source project. Lastly, I want to make a great game mode with great people.
